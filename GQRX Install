To test your frequencies you must first install a programme called "GQRX" 

Run these commands 

sudo apt install gnuradio gqrx-sdr 

gqrx 

Once GQRX has launched you need to select your SDR from the drop down menu you are presented with on launch.  

Tune GQRX to your country specific frequency, these are listed below, ensure that you tune to the primary worldwide channel as well as the primary channel for your region. 

For each tuning you can adjust the Rf Gain and Tuned Bandwidth (Set to 5-10KHz) to obtain the best signal. 

Ensure you are set to “AM” and that “Squelch” is turned off
